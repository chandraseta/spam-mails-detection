Not to beat a dead horse, but that is exactly what my spamcan package
did.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
, but I am not going
to work on it anymore.
I am currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer).  I will probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it is not too hard.  The hard part is storing the
data somewhere.  I do not want to use ZODB, as I would like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is
looking like my best option.
I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.
Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:
  train-eggs
  train-spam
  trained-eggs
  trained-spam
You copy all your spam and eggs* into the "train-" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you would get better
results if you did it more often, and you would be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she is
done, she moves your mail into the "trained-" folders.
This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server.  I have spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.
Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key "S" to "move to train-spam" and "H" to "move to
train-eggs".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it would
start showing up in mail clients.  that is the "delete as spam" button
Paul Graham was talking about.
* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word "ham" as the
  opposite of "spam", and they have been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling
  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
  "eggs".
