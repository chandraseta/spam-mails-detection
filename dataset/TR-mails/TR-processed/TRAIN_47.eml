[ILUG] gargnome & sawfish..
 I decided to try out GarGnome, to see what gnome2 looks like. it is
pretty, I will give it that.
 However, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all
over the place, so I tryed out metacity - which does not have a GUI
configurator, and arsed if I am going back to the fvwm days when you had to
set settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like.
 So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish cannot start applets (yes, I did
change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel cannot make new workspaces.
 Any ideas what could have happened ? Would sawfish 2.0 silently change
the config files & break them?
