oh yes, see you have setup that tdma thingy, so here's a thought. do
you reckon spammers (or the software they use) is/are smart enough to
	s/\(.\)+\+.*@\([a-zA-Z\.0-9\-]\)/\1@\2/
on email addresses? it is a fairly old trick, so i do not see why they
would not.
personally, i rarely get spam to any of the plussed addresses
i've given out - i think i've only ever gotten /one/ because ebay 
seem to have sold on my address. apart from that - never, not even 
to +usenet, so i wonder whether harvesting software does the above.
