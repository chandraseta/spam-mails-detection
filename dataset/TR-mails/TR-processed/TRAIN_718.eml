that is not a difference. I do not use it, either. My use of Compiz was 
just a part of exploration of the Gnome DE. I do not even use Gnome now.

Neither do I. that is why I use Xfce.

I occasionally turn on Xfce's compositing for specific tasks in which it 
actually makes my work easier. But most if the time, it is off.

nv - Debian Squeeze
Gave up finally in December last year trying to get the blobs to work 
reliably. they are simply not worth the effort for someone with my 
particular needs.
I am reasonably happy with the systems with the nvidia workstation cards. 
But the cheaper systems with Intel and ATI graphics are faster and 
handle any special effects I might want (like occasional use of desktop 
compositing) better, and I am happier with them. Nvidia is simply not on 
my radar for any future systems because I consider their approach to 
Linux to be inimical to FOSS.
PS: My apologies. Recent update to my mail client coupled with lack of 
sleep. I accidentally sent Ron a direct e-mail reply. Mea culpa.
