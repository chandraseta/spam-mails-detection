Well, it is been half a week since we released it, and we are still
getting record downloads for our first
FREE Gnometome. What does
that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we will definitely make
more. In fact, we have found a way to get your products and services
a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who
could not use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your
data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you
get featured). it is all fun and games until someone's server falls
to its knees. we are still sitting
at #5 on Amazon. If we ever
hit #1, I will eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. you would have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you would get
from my hat. you are better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: "Do you care to Super Size that?"
You can respond, with dignity: "My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful because, and not have killed me
earlier." It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries are not
going to eat themselves. And if YOU do not eat the fries, who will?
Put your hunger aside for just a moment. it is time for a paragraph
I like to call: "Why you should not sign up for DirectDSL." They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you are thinking: "How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which were not confirmed. But the fun did not stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. it is my "direct" way of saying: you are
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I did not think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people
from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more
junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate?
My good buddy, Bill,
tells me that Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. he will even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: "Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: "Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period." All the more fries
for me, dude!
See You in August,              Chris Pirillo

Company Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.toteboard.net/Models/company_overview.htm
{Check your stocks} When you are doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then "forget
about it." Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. he is always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. that is a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, "E*TRADE
does not give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information." NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.
Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/
{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
do not need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
"Shortcut to" and "Copy of" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. that is not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you do not like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from "Chris" to
"Caspian Wildflowers"...)

Disk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html
{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I will know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
    Unearthed by Michael Tretyakov
http://www.actualtools.com/
{Windows Explorer add-on} "Actual Title Buttons let us you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons." This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the "Stay On Top" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
"important" instant messages. The only difference is that they
are not an annoyance now. The "Minimize To Tray" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you do not have to close down your programs to do
it.

{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You will not be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this was not good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless!

 GnomeTIP
I just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program does not
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
"voicewarmup" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =
Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; you = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the "Temp" directory and look for my log
files. they will vary in name, but will always start with "Msi" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your
registry before making any modifications.

And now, we see how Sprocket thinks he has a right to eat pumpkin seeds. Or, would that be "pupkin" seeds?
