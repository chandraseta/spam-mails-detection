Sorting
Is there a way to do a global Sort command? Here's the situation: I like to 
sort by date every folder. I am cleaning up my inbox from most recent to oldest, 
since I find this direction most efficient (I guess because it helps me 
recognize the significance of individual, old messages). But this adds messages 
to my other folders in the wrong order. When I am done, I would like to re-sort all 
the folders I have changed.
