Thanks!
In the past I tried "lilo -you /dev/hda" and it would not work -- an
original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
Which is exactly what I did not have.  The installation of Linux
Mandrake did not afford me that luxury.
Also, I am glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
This is obviously not the case.
