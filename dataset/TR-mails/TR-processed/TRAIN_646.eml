strange issue after upgrading to latest 10.6.3
Hi folks,
I *think* this happened after upgrading to 10.6.3, but I also recall
there was a security patch, I apologize because I was sort of
absentmindedly updating myself which I had not done in a while.  So...er,
not exactly sure what the because is.  But, the issue is this:
When I am using X11/XQuartz (I have just tried the default xterm as well as
rxvt I installed via macports), what seems to happen is that I can open
a terminal and use it for a little while, but if I leave x11, that is if
it looses focus, and then I come back, I can no longer switch between
windows, enter anything with the keyboard, click and select windows with
my mouse, etc.  All input to x11 seems to be dead.  I have to kill it
and then restart it again to get it to work at all, and then the same
thing happens.  I have tried reinstalling it but that has not helped.
Does this behavior ring a bell to anyone?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated, I live in rxvt and do not like using Terminal.app very much!
Thanks--
Dave
