Holidays for freshrpms.net :-)
Hi all,
I will be leaving this evening until next Monday, with no access to
whatsoever to a single computer until then, woohoo, real holidays! :-)
So do not be worried if there is a new release of <insert your favorite
freshrpms package here> and that it is not updated quickly despite your many
requests to the list ;-)
Before going, I did repackage the latest hackedbox and lbreakout2 that both
came out today.
Have fun! (I will!! ;-))
Matthias
