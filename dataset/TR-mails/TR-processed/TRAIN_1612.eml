This only restates the assertion, it does not clarify /how/ government
restrains you, other than under laws of criminal conduct and violent
crimes (if you meant the above literally)
If I can trace a spammer to their ISP, I can /generally/ get that
account revoked, and if you trace one to their parent corporation, I
do not know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits,
it is just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.  If you
have some law that prevents action against spammers, then why all the
class-action suits and other anti-spam court cases, some even
state-funded?
I am also curious of the mechanics of your retribution strategy: let us
say you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in
the USA, do you really believe 40 Beijing spammers will not fill the
void?  Do you really believe those 40 are not right now prepping their
mail servers whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? How do
you intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a
world away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone
understand how to properly bribe?  
I am not so hopeful this method can work against aromatherapy viagra
when we cannot even track and convict murderous Nigerian mafia, and
they are blatant!  Political solution is a contradiction in terms, and
it is also true that no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the
catalyst on improving the quality of life in Britain and the western
world as did central heating and the invention of one A.J.Crapper.
