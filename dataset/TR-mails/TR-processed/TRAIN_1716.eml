introductions
As I have had to resubscribe to fork and fork-noarchive,
I guess I have to reintroduce myself.  I am formerly
known as gbolcer at endtech dot com to the FoRK
mailman program, formerly an overposter, and love
soaking up bits through avid reading or scanning
of almost every single list that is got informative to say. 
Hopefully all those overpost will get cleared out at
somepoint and fork-archived.   
Greg
