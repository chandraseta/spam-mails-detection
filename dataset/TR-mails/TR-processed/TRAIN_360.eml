Re: introductions
I would like to claim the parenthood of desktop web services,
but then there is a ton of people doing it now.  
What I am the parent of is, Jackson Alan Bolcer--I just
realized that the birth announcement was something that
did not get sent through due to my general laziness of
being kicked off of FoRK from our stupid DNS fiasco
mixed with the post filtering.   August 20th, 7lbs, 14oz,
8:30pm.
