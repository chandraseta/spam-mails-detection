I found the new icons do not have enough contrast to be easily
distinguishable so I changed the icons theme. Unfortunately, some apps
still use the new ones; I am guessing this may be due to gnome icon
symlinks named gtk-*.
Once Gnome 2.30 is fully in Squeeze, I am hoping to find some time to
discover what hacks are required to get legible icons again.
