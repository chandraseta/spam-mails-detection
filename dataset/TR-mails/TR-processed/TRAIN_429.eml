Barbara Babbles;
Be amazed - I have never bought anything online since an almighty cock up
with amazon dot con (that is not a typo) a few years back where I lost
all the dosh I would paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
it been the UK branch I would have had them in the small claims court
quicker than you could drop LOTR on your foot and say "ouch", but as it
was the US branch I would just no comeback.
