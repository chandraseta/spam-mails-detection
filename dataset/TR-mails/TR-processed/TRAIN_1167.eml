My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:
  Using a database:
   real    8m24.741s
   user    6m19.410s
   sys     1m33.650s
  Using a pickle:
   real    1m39.824s
   user    1m36.400s
   sys     0m2.160s
This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I do not know what it is *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).
For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:
   real    0m29.592s
   user    0m28.050s
   sys     0m1.180s
Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it is compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we will never be
able to outperform it.  it is something to keep in mind, though.
I do not have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I am not sure that is a fair test. ;)  In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  
On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.
