Not unless you want to upgrade your entire system to Sid.  To install
only certain cherry-picked applications from Sid, you have to use
apt pinning.  And do not use synaptic.  (But since you do not have X
running, you cannot use synaptic.  Yet.  But once you get it running,
do not use synaptic.  I have heard that it does not respect apt pinning.)
