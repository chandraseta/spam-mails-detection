I do not know if there is a sendmail-ish way (it is not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:
$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter
If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
is built-in.  If you get something like:
Warning: Filter usage ('X') requires Milter support (-DMILTER)
Milter Warning: Option: %s requires Milter support (-DMILTER)

then it is not built-in. :)
