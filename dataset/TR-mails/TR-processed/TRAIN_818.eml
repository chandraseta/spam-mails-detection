RE: [Razor-users] Re: intentions
Yeh it sure would be nice to have more info on Tes.  That would end all
the confusion. 
Can Spamassassin be considered a competing product when it is typically
used in conjunction with Razor?

Craig,
    I do not really understand how you can make the claims that you
    make without a full understanding of TeS, which you cannot have
    because we have not published the details.
    In the end, given that you do not know much about TeS or how it
    works, your statements really call into question your intentions
    given that you have a competing product in this space.
