[Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41
This is my first time running Razor, heard a lot of good things about it so
I thought I would give it a shot.  I also run SpamAssassin so I would like to
integrate the two.
I am not sure if this problem is with SpamAssassin or Razor, so I though I would
shoot the message here first
With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I am seeing these
messages spit out from spamd:
razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory cannot call method "log" on
unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm
line 211,  line 75.
Any ideas?  razor seems to run correctly over the command line.
Thanks,
-Dave
