height=111>Introduction We sell Backup 
CDs, also known as Warez CDs. Backup CDs are copies of Software. 
For example if you go into a shop and buy Windows XP Pro, for about $299 you 
get the Serial, the CD, the Box and the Manual.If you order it off us, 
you get:The Windows XP CD and the Serial Number. It works exactly the same, 
but you do not get the manual and box and the price is only $19.99.That is a 
saving of $280, and the only difference is you do not have a colorful box and 
manual - which are not very 
useful.

400 applications- over 1500 games- we reply at all your requests in a 
few hours- newest releases - we have the best price on the WEB- best

now that the CD I ordered had arrived. I was a little suspicious when I ordered 
the stuff, but I was wrong. Thanks for your services and never let the site go 
down.
