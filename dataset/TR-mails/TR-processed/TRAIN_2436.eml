 I do not really see the problem... either the whole message is unwanted spam
which you, one way or another, did not agree to reciving, or it is something that
you, one way or another, said that you would accept... If you said you would accept it,
like mailinglists, then it is not spam and should not be caught as spam, no
matter if there is ads in it or not...
