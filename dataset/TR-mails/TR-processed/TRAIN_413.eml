openssh-3.0.2p1-1
I think that is directly from openssh site. it is from the RH 6.2 that I 
upgraded to 7.2 (6.2 does not ship with openssh...). 
I probably should downgrade to the versoin RH provides except I cannot do 
that as I do not have physical access to that box and downgrading ssh 
packages over ssh does not sound like a bright idea...
