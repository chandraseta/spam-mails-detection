Netscape 7 Review
This is my Netscape 7.0 Review.
o They finally got the email search speed back up to
   where it was in 4.7.x
o Setting up user mail accounts does not have that really
   odd, sometimes it let us me sometimes it does not problem that
   previous versions had.
o I still have to manually update all my address books by
   hand but at least it let us me import them as Netscape 4.x
   address books (there is not 6.x import as they just assume
   it works--which it does not)
o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that
   I have tried to report since 4.0.2 where you cannot store a mail
   filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
   Gawd I would really wish they would fix that freakin' bug, it is the single
   biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it is one of the
   most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
o Webex does not support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin does not
   work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to
   work on something with someone remotely.
I have given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the
source I send always get lost.
