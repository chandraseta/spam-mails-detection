[Spambayes] cannot write to CVS...
I am listed as a developer on SF and have the spambayes CVS module checked
out using my SF username, but I am unable to write to the repository.  CVS
complains:
    % cvs add unheader.py
    cvs [server aborted]: "add" requires write access to the repository
Any thoughts?
